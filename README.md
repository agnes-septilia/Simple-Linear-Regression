# Simple-Linear-Regression - The Formula Breakdown
Simple Linear Regression explained in it's formulas. Written in R (.rmd)

Hi! 
About last week (21/10/31), I just learn about Linear Regression in R.
Although I could understand the lesson, I still feel confused on how this thing works.
Let's admit, I don't have statistic background at all. So this is very new to me.

After the lesson, pretty sure I still can do the task well simply because R already make it easy.
Put one-two line of codes and done!
But I still feel I want to learn beneath; in order to understand the concept more clearly.

I searched through many examples online, and built the model using Excel to display each formula's output.
Once I figured it out, I converted it in R language.
So now, instead of simple one-two lines of code (which I was taught), I make the breakdown of each steps that made the complete Simple Linear Regression analysis.

In the code we will have three parts:
1. How to get the regression formula, or we usually call as `y = a + bx`
2. Check the residual and its distribution
3. Standardized (Normalized) the residuals and make qqplot duplicate using geom_* function

The code is written in .Rmd, and I upload the word file if you want to see the knitted report.

I hope this breakdown will help anyone who interested in how to learn the detail about Simple Linear Regression.
If any concern, feel free to inform me.
Thank you!
