# Simple-Linear-Regression---The-Breakdown
Simple Linear Regression explained in it's formulas. Written in R (.rmd)

Hi! 
About last week (21/10/31), I just learn about Linear Regression in R.
Although I could understand the lesson, I still feel confused on how this things works.
Look, I don't have statistic background at all. So this is very new to me.

After the lesson, pretty sure I still can do the task well simply because R already make it easy.
Put one-two line of code and we got the result already.
But I'm afraid - since Linear Regression is only the start of Machine Learning - if I don't understand it, it will be hard to understand the next concept.

So, I learn from the scratch. 
Built simple example using the excel, and convert it into R language.
Instead of simple one-two lines of code, we will see each formulas that made the Simple Linear Regression.

There is more possibility we can do with this code, and I may update it if necessary.
Hope this code helps, thank you!
